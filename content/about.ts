  "Master's candidate at George Washington University (Data Science, 3.77, Global Leaders Award). At Jio Platforms I shipped ML pipelines across hybrid AWS/Azure/GCP — 85% faster deploys, 99.9% pipeline reliability, 100K events/sec under real-time load. At GWU I've built 3D detection pipelines for biomedical cryo-electron tomography (mAP@50 = 0.948) and benchmarked 15+ neural architectures on 916 hours of pediatric EEG.",
